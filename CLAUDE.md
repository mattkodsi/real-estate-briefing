# Real Estate News Briefing

A web app that compiles Matthew's real estate newsletters into a daily briefing with an in-app reader, deal map, weekly summary, players roster (accumulating people/company dossiers), a dictionary of jargon/concepts, and a history archive.
Static site (no build step): `index.html` + `css/style.css` + `js/app.js`, pipeline helpers in `scripts/`. Leaflet (CDN) powers the map.

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages, custom domain `briefing.pierrepontcompanies.com` (`CNAME` file). Deploys happen only when app code changes — data never requires a deploy. **When deploying js/css changes, bump the `?v=` query on both asset tags in `index.html`** — it prevents cached pages from pairing old code with new data shapes.
- **Data**: Supabase project `uhwdnmbxiopfysodydty` (org ptxdileqdzaovbezrplg) — tables `days` (pk `date`, `data` jsonb, `generated_at`), `weeks` (pk `week_of`, `data` jsonb, `generated_at`), `players` (pk `slug`, `data` jsonb, `updated_at`), and `terms` (pk `slug`, `data` jsonb, `updated_at`). RLS is open read AND open write on the publishable key (owner's accepted tradeoff, single-user app); DELETE is revoked at the DB level on all four tables. The app reads it live via PostgREST.
- **Local dev**: the `briefing` config in `.claude/launch.json` (python3 http.server, port 8420) — the app reads Supabase either way. `data/` holds the pipeline's working JSON files and is gitignored (also keeps subscriber-only article text out of the public repo).

## Architecture

1. Scheduled cloud routines on claude.ai (windows: 7:30, 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 10:00 AM, 12:00, 2:00, 4:00 PM ET; hardware-independent — they run in Anthropic's cloud against this repo) read the day's real estate newsletters from Gmail, synthesizes ONE deduped story list, fetches full article text, geocodes deal locations, writes `data/YYYY-MM-DD.json`, updates the rolling week file `data/weeks/<monday>.json`, maintains `data/index.json` (`{dates: [], weeks: []}`), then **publishes with `python3 scripts/push_data.py`** (upserts days + weeks + players + terms to Supabase). Runs are idempotent: each rebuilds today's file from ALL of today's emails (`after:` today, America/New_York — not `newer_than:1d`), keeping existing story ids stable.
2. The app has six hash-routed views — Briefing (`#/day/DATE`), Map (`#/map`), Weekly (`#/weekly`), Players (`#/players`, profiles at `#/player/SLUG`), Dictionary (`#/dictionary`, entries at `#/term/SLUG`), Rates (`#/rates`) — plus History (`#/history`, reached by tapping the masthead date, not a tab) and a full-screen reader overlay (`#/story/DATE/ID`). A masthead refresh button (and auto-refetch every 10 min / on tab focus) re-queries Supabase and re-renders when `generatedAt` changes; pulling NEW emails always happens through a task run, not the page.

## Newsletter sources (Gmail senders)

- Inman — `select@inman.com` (Morning Headlines) and `headlines@inman.com` (Afternoon Headlines / Newsflash), both daily
- CRE Daily — `mail@news.credaily.com` (daily; often carries full story text in the email)
- CRE Daily New York — `mail@newyork.credaily.com` (daily)
- The Real Deal — `elerts@e.therealdeal.com` (mix of daily elerts, weekly recaps, and special/breaking blasts)
- Traded — senders on BOTH `traded.co` and `tradedmedia.co` (e.g. `hello@tradedmedia.co`); search both domains (National digest ~2×/week; treat regular editions as `daily` cadence). Traded editions are lists of individual closings/listings — each deal (address, price, buyer/seller/broker) becomes its own story with a precise `locations` pin; these are the best map content we get. Group them under a market-level `section` (New York, National, ...) and don't mark routine deal items `featured` unless one is genuinely headline-scale.

Also include any other newsletter that is clearly real-estate news. Skip welcome/confirmation emails, job alerts, meetup blasts, and promotional one-offs.

## Daily update procedure (for the scheduled task)

1. Search Gmail: `from:(select@inman.com OR headlines@inman.com OR mail@news.credaily.com OR mail@newyork.credaily.com OR elerts@e.therealdeal.com OR traded.co OR tradedmedia.co) after:<today>` — plus a broader pass for other real-estate newsletters received today (America/New_York).
2. For each newsletter, get the message and extract stories from the HTML body. Large bodies get saved to a tool-results file; parse with python (`html.parser`), never by reading raw HTML into context. Tracking links like `link.therealdeal.com/click/<id>/<base64>` decode via urlsafe-base64 (pad with `=`) to the real article URL — strip query params.
3. **Classify cadence** per newsletter edition: `daily` (regular daily edition), `weekly` (weekly recap/digest), or `special` (breaking-news or one-off themed blast). Every story inherits its newsletter's cadence.
4. **Synthesize** ONE deduped story list. Same story in two newsletters → one entry, both names in `sources`. Assign each story a short reusable `section` (New York, Capital Markets, Residential, Development, Policy, Tech, ...). Mark the 3–5 most important `featured: true`.
5. **Classify** every story for the app's filters, chips, and map icons — all four fields, consistently:
   - `dealType` — exactly one of: `Sale`, `Financing`, `Lease`, `Development`, `Distress`, `Legal`, `Policy`, `Industry`, `Markets`. Pick the story's dominant nature (a bankruptcy-driven sale → Distress; a lawsuit → Legal; company/people/tech news → Industry; data/trend pieces → Markets).
   - `assetClass` — `Multifamily`, `Office`, `Retail`, `Industrial`, `Hotel`, `Residential` (single-family/condo/luxury homes), `Mixed-Use`, `Land`, or `null` when not asset-specific.
   - `market` — short reusable metro/region label. Reuse existing ones before inventing: New York, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, South Florida, Texas, DFW, Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, New Jersey, Phoenix, Atlanta, Denver, Austin, San Diego, National.
   - `valueUsd` — the single deal size in dollars as a plain number (e.g. 81400000); `null` when there is no single figure (permit recaps, roundups, policy pieces).
5. **Geocode**: for stories tied to identifiable places (a property, site, submarket, or city), add `locations: [{label, lat, lng}]` — approximate coordinates from knowledge are fine (city/neighborhood precision; a specific address if confident). Stories with no meaningful geography (national policy, earnings) get `locations: []`.
6. **Reader content** per story, in order of preference: (a) full story text extracted from the email body itself when the newsletter carries it (CRE Daily often does) — include `<figure>/<img>/<figcaption>`; (b) `python3 scripts/fetch_article.py <url>` → JSON `{ok, title, image, html, words}`; if `ok`, use `html` as `content` and `image` as hero; (c) neither → `content: null` (app falls back to summary + link).
   - **The Real Deal (subscriber articles)**: fetch_article.py automatically sends the owner's TRD session cookie (stored in the Supabase `secrets` table, row `trd_session`). TRD's reader site is Next.js with its own (non-WordPress) login, so the session is captured by the owner pasting their browser cookie header into `python3 scripts/trd_session.py --cookie` — the pipeline never sees a password. If a therealdeal.com fetch returns `paywalled: true`, the session has expired: still write the story with `content: null`, and say in the day's `notes` that the TRD session needs a refresh (`python3 scripts/trd_session.py --cookie`).
7. Write `data/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (schema below). Create the `data/` directory if it doesn't exist. (`data/index.json` is a legacy local-dev artifact — ignore it if absent; the app reads Supabase, not files.)
8. **Weekly rollup**: compute the week's Monday. Rewrite `data/weeks/<monday>.json` synthesizing ALL of that week's days so far (schema below) — synthesize across days, don't just concatenate. **In a fresh checkout (cloud runs) the earlier day files won't exist locally** — fetch them from Supabase instead: `GET <SUPABASE_URL>/rest/v1/days?date=gte.<monday>&date=lte.<today>&select=data` with the `apikey` header, using the URL and key found in `scripts/push_data.py`.
9. **Players roster**: maintain the persistent people/companies dossier set behind the app's Players tab. Fetch the current roster from Supabase (`GET <SUPABASE_URL>/rest/v1/players?select=slug,data` with the `apikey` header), merge today's stories into it, write the complete result to `data/players.json` (schema below). Curation rules — these keep the roster valuable instead of unwieldy:
   - **Who gets a profile.** People: only when a story is substantially *about* them (protagonist of a deal, fund event, lawsuit, interview, appointment). Companies: story subject, or a named principal (buyer / seller / developer / lender / borrower / landlord) in a deal ≥ $25M or a lease ≥ 100K sf.
   - **Who waits in `_candidates`.** Names appearing only as deal-party credits in digest items (Traded blurbs, permit recaps) — brokers, small-deal principals, execs named beside their firm — get a tally in the `_candidates` row instead of a profile. Promote to a full profile on the **second** sighting (any size), then remove the ledger entry.
   - **Who never enters.** Celebrities/athletes/entertainers in personal-home deals, private individuals buying homes, tenants/occupiers acting purely as space users (profile the landlord, not the tenant), reporters, quoted analysts.
   - **Updating an existing profile.** Append today's mention(s) newest-first — the full mention history is kept forever, never trimmed. Update `stats` (`dealVolumeUsd` sums `valueUsd` only where the entity was a transaction principal, not a mere story subject), extend `markets`/`assetClasses`, refresh `lastSeen`. Rewrite `profile`/`tagline` only when today's news meaningfully changes the picture; otherwise leave the prose alone.
   - **Profiles are permanent.** Never delete a profile, a mention, or a `_candidates` tally (the only removal ever allowed is a candidate's ledger entry at the moment it's promoted to a full profile). Dormant entities are not cleaned up — the app's recency-weighted ranking simply sinks them, and search still finds them. The database also enforces this: the publishable key has no DELETE permission on `players` (or `days`/`weeks`/`rates`).
   - **One slug per entity, forever.** Check for aliases before creating (e.g. "Blackstone" vs "Blackstone Group"; people by full name). Never re-slug.
   - **Aliases** (`aliases` field): short alternate names the app auto-links wherever they appear in prose (summaries, articles, dossiers) — e.g. "NAR", "Elliman", "Brookfield", "Oren Alexander". Add them when an entity is commonly referenced by a shorter or different name. Keep them unambiguous and case-exact: never a common English word, never something that could be a different entity. (People with simple two-word names get bare-surname linking automatically — no alias needed for that.)
   - **Profile image** (`image` field): source a stable square image URL when creating a profile, in order of preference:
     1. Companies: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=<their domain>&sz=128` — verify with `curl -sL` that the followed redirect returns HTTP 200 (a 404 means no logo that size). Find the real domain first (a web search is fine — e.g. Lift Partners is liftrp.com, not liftpartners.com).
     2. People: the Wikipedia thumbnail from `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/<Title>` ONLY after checking the page description actually matches this person (namesakes are common).
     3. People/companies with no favicon or Wikipedia entry: find an official headshot or logo (the firm's own team/leadership page, the person's own site), download it, downscale to ≤400px, and **re-host it in the public `player-images` storage bucket** so it can never rot: `curl -X POST <SUPABASE_URL>/storage/v1/object/player-images/<slug>.<ext> -H "apikey: <key>" -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" -H "Content-Type: image/<ext>" -H "x-upsert: true" --data-binary @file`, then store `<SUPABASE_URL>/storage/v1/object/public/player-images/<slug>.<ext>`. Never hotlink news-article or team-page photos directly — re-host them.
     `null` is always fine; the app renders an initials monogram. If `image` is null when an entity resurfaces, try again — a domain or team page may be identifiable from the new story.
10. **Dictionary**: maintain the persistent glossary behind the app's Dictionary tab. Fetch the current dictionary from Supabase (`GET <SUPABASE_URL>/rest/v1/terms?select=slug,data` with the `apikey` header), merge today's stories into it, write the complete result to `data/terms.json` (schema below). Curation rules:
    - **Who gets an entry.** Jargon or concepts a smart reader without real-estate background wouldn't know: deal/finance mechanics (cap rate, mezzanine debt, DSCR, CMBS, defeasance, 1031 exchange), legal/regulatory constructs (FARE Act, TOPA, Ellis Act eviction), industry-specific structures (syndication, ground lease, triple net, opportunity zone). Skip plain English and anything already self-explanatory in context.
    - **Who never enters.** Company/person names (that's the Players roster), plain financial terms a general-news reader already knows (mortgage, landlord, tenant), one-off proper nouns that won't recur.
    - **Updating an existing entry.** Append today's mention(s) newest-first — mention history is kept forever, never trimmed. Refresh `stats.lastSeen`/`mentions`. Rewrite `definition`/`shortDef` only if today's usage reveals the existing explanation is wrong or incomplete; otherwise leave the prose alone.
    - **Entries are permanent.** Never delete an entry or a mention — same DB-enforced guarantee as `players` (no DELETE grant on `terms`).
    - **One slug per concept, forever.** Check for aliases before creating (e.g. "Cap Rate" vs "Capitalization Rate"). Never re-slug.
    - **Aliases** (`aliases` field): alternate names/abbreviations the app auto-links wherever they appear in prose — e.g. "DSCR" for "Debt Service Coverage Ratio". Keep them unambiguous.
    - **Category** (`category` field): a short reusable label — Valuation & Returns, Financing & Debt, Legal & Regulatory, Deal Structures, Market Mechanics, Tax — reuse existing ones before inventing.
11. Validate all written files with `python3 -m json.tool`.
12. **Publish**: `python3 scripts/push_data.py` — upserts every local day and week file plus `data/players.json` and `data/terms.json` to Supabase. The hosted app updates within seconds (no deploy involved).
13. **Rates**: `python3 scripts/fetch_rates.py` — pulls the daily Treasury par yield curve (treasury.gov) and SOFR + compounded averages (NY Fed), and publishes to the Supabase `rates` table. Feeds the app's Rates page and the masthead ticker. Run it every pipeline run; it's cheap and idempotent. **It works even where the run environment's egress policy blocks treasury.gov/newyorkfed.org** (cloud runs often do): it automatically falls back to the Supabase-hosted `rates-live` edge function, which fetches the same sources server-side. A `WARN … falling back` line is normal in the cloud — the run still succeeded. Only an `ERROR` + exit 1 (both paths down) is a failure worth recording in the day's `notes`.

    }
  ],
  "notes": "optional: anything unusual (missing editions, new subscriptions)"
}
```

If no newsletters arrived, still write the file: overview says so, `stories: []`, note why.

## Data schema — `data/weeks/<monday YYYY-MM-DD>.json`

```json
{
  "weekOf": "YYYY-MM-DD (Monday)",
  "generatedAt": "ISO-8601 UTC",

  "topStories": [{ "day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "id": "story id in that day file", "title": "", "source": "" }],
  "notes": "optional; mention if the week is still in progress"
}
```

## Data schema — `data/players.json`

The whole roster in one file; `push_data.py` upserts each entry as its own `players` row. The app hides any slug starting with `_`.

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "players": {

    }
  }
}
```

## Data schema — `data/terms.json`

The whole dictionary in one file; `push_data.py` upserts each entry as its own `terms` row.

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "terms": {
    "cap-rate": {
      "term": "Cap Rate",
      "category": "Valuation & Returns | Financing & Debt | Legal & Regulatory | Deal Structures | Market Mechanics | Tax",
      "aliases": ["short alternate names/abbreviations for auto-linking in prose; [] if none"],
      "shortDef": "one sentence, ≤25 words — for the dictionary card view",
      "definition": "2–4 sentences, plain language, assumes no prior knowledge; separate paragraphs with \\n\\n",
      "stats": { "mentions": 2, "firstSeen": "YYYY-MM-DD", "lastSeen": "YYYY-MM-DD" },
      "mentions": [
        { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "id": "story id in that day file", "title": "story headline" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Writing style

**Write for a smart reader who doesn't know any of the names — in as few words as possible.** Every company and person gets a compact identifying clause on first reference in any prose field: "Dallas syndicator S2 Capital", "ex-Buffett protégé Ian Jacobs", "Asana Partners, a Charlotte urban-retail specialist" — never a bare name, never a full sentence of biography. Assume no memory of prior days' coverage. Maximize information per word: keep every number, cut connective tissue. Targets: `overview` ≈ 100 words; each `keyPoint` ≤ 30 words.

- `overview` and `keyPoints` do different jobs and must not overlap. The bullets carry the facts; the overview carries the *meaning*. Never write the overview as a prose version of the bullets.
- `overview` is the **signal lede**: (a) the through-line connecting today's stories, (b) how today moves the running arcs — cite prior coverage when it does ("a day after Compass's $1.6B Anywhere deal drew a class action…"), (c) the stakes. Fetch the prior 2–3 days from Supabase (same query as the weekly rollup) and read their overviews/keyPoints before writing it — continuity is the point. It may reference bullet facts as evidence in an argument, never re-explain them. Ban scene-setting filler — "rounds out today's coverage", "a busy day in…" carry zero information.
- `keyPoints`: each bullet stands alone as identified actor + number + significance. The test: someone reading only the bullets, knowing nothing, should come away understanding the day.
- `watch`: 1–3 forward-looking catalysts with dates ("Fed bill-purchase decision Aug. 13", "S2's five North Texas foreclosure auctions land this month"), ≤20 words each, drawn from today's and recent stories. Only include real, dated events — never vague "keep an eye on" items.
- `summary` (per story): concrete who/what/how-much, actors identified the same way, in your own words.
- `content` is mechanical extraction (email body or fetch_article.py output), not rewriting.
- `explainer` (optional, per story): for stories whose article assumes mechanics a smart non-specialist wouldn't know — Fed plumbing, securitization/CMBS, rate math, legal/land-use structures — write 2–4 short paragraphs that re-tell the story plainly: what happened, how the mechanism works (define each moving part in a clause), and why it matters for real estate. End with the "so what". Separate paragraphs with \\n\\n. It renders in a box under the full article as a supplement, never a replacement. Most stories don't need one; add it only where the source text would genuinely lose a general reader — target 2–5 per day, null otherwise.
- Section names stay short and reusable day-to-day.
- `shortDef`/`definition` (dictionary terms): explain the mechanism, not just a synonym — a reader should understand *why* it matters, not just what to call it. No circular definitions ("a cap rate is a rate used to cap...").

Bad (color, no context): "S2 Capital's $400M first fund collapses as the Sun Belt syndication unwind claims another victim."
Bad (context, too wordy): "S2 Capital — a Dallas syndicator that built one of the Sun Belt's largest value-add apartment operations (roughly $11B transacted since 2012) on floating-rate debt — is dissolving its $400M first fund with zero return to investors."
Good: "S2 Capital, the Dallas syndicator that built ~$11B of Sun Belt apartments on floating-rate debt, is dissolving its $400M first fund at a total loss — rents fell 24%, interest costs rose 50%."
